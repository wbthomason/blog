	abstract = {This paper presents a reasoning system that enables a group of heterogeneous robots to form coalitions to accomplish a multirobot task using tightly coupled sensor sharing. Our approach, which we call ASyMTRe, maps environmental sensors and perceptual and motor control schemas to the required flow of information through the multirobot system, automatically reconfiguring the connections of schemas within and across robots to synthesize valid and efficient multirobot behaviors for accomplishing a multirobot task. We present the centralized anytime ASyMTRe configuration algorithm, proving that the algorithm is correct, and formally addressing issues of completeness and optimality. We then present a distributed version of ASyMTRe, called ASyMTRe-D, which uses communication to enable distributed coalition formation. We validate the centralized approach by applying the ASyMTRe methodology to two application scenarios: multirobot transportation and multirobot box pushing. We then validate the ASyMTRe-D implementation in the multirobot transportation task, illustrating its fault-tolerance capabilities. The advantages of this new approach are that it: 1) enables robots to synthesize new task solutions using fundamentally different combinations of sensors and effectors for different coalition compositions and 2) provides a general mechanism for sharing sensory information across networked robots},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00200},
	abstract = {We present a centralized algorithmic framework for solving multi-robot path planning problems in general, two-dimensional, continuous environments while minimizing globally the task completion time. The framework obtains high levels of effectiveness through the composition of an optimal discretization of the continuous environment and the subsequent fast, near-optimal resolution of the resulting discrete planning problem. This principled approach achieves orders of magnitudes better performance with respect to both speed and the supported robot density. For a wide variety of environments, our method is shown to compute globally near-optimal solutions for fifty robots in seconds with robots packed close to each other. In the extreme, the method can consistently solve problems with hundreds of robots that occupy over 30\% of the free space.},

	abstract = {In safety mission, search and rescue, the two main tasks are detecting the location of the survivors and evacuate them from a building full of danger. In many cases, the environment inside the building is unknown which prevents the robot team to provide instant aid for the situation. In this project, a new approach is presented as a solution to this problem. It consists of a ground vehicle used for the purpose of environment mapping, a micro aerial vehicle used simultaneously for the purpose of search and localization with a vertical camera and a horizontal camera, and two other micro ground vehicles with sonar, compass and colour sensor used as the back-up team. Experimental results are presented demonstrating this multi robot team's ability to complete tasks faster than a single robot rescuer in indoor environments.},

	title = {Several types of types in programming languages},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03726},
	abstract = {Types are an important part of any modern programming language, but we often forget that the concept of type we understand nowadays is not the same it was perceived in the sixties. Moreover, we conflate the concept of "type" in programming languages with the concept of the same name in mathematical logic, an identification that is only the result of the convergence of two different paths, which started apart with different aims. The paper will present several remarks (some historical, some of more conceptual character) on the subject, as a basis for a further investigation. The thesis we will argue is that there are three different characters at play in programming languages, all of them now called types: the technical concept used in language design to guide implementation; the general abstraction mechanism used as a modelling tool; the classifying tool inherited from mathematical logic. We will suggest three possible dates ad quem for their presence in the programming language literature, suggesting that the emergence of the concept of type in computer science is relatively independent from the logical tradition, until the Curry-Howard isomorphism will make an explicit bridge between them.},
