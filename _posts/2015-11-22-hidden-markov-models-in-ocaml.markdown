In this thrilling installment of *something bloglike*, we're going to learn
about Hidden Markov Models (more succinctly referred to as HMMs). We'll start
with the math behind the model, and then work through a practical
implementation, which the Magical Wheel of Languages™ says will be in OCaml.
You can find the final implementation [here][crouchingtigerhiddenmarkov].
Everything necessary will be explained from fundamentals, so you shouldn't
need any preexisting knowledge (other than familiarity with OCaml) to get the
gist of the tutorial. That said, a basic grounding in probability may help you
grasp the concepts more easily.

# overview

Let's imagine that you have a problem[^1]. As a lowly intern at Microoglebook™,
you've been tasked with predicting 



# the math

In the beginning was the Markov Property, and the Markov Property was good. The
Markov property (as a moderate grasp of naming conventions and foreshadowing
should lead you to expect) is really the crux of the entire family of Markov
models, of which there are a fair few.
